Heeey. My name's Eric. I'm a web developer, or, "I work with computers" if you're my wife and you're introducing me to your grandmother for the first time.

I sort of took a break from this site for a few years, and now I have a whole new name and a baby!

I'm going to try to write some more this year and share things
that I like.
